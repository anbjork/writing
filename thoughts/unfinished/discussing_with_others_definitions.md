Mathematics shows us that words are exchangeable, and don't mean more than what they are defined to mean, regardless of what implication is sought

I am happy I've seen enough math to realise this. It provides a nice perspective on the rest of the world. In a lot of other disciplines like politics, people seem to never tire of twisting words and definitions to suit their point. When you've realised how pointless that is, that's a whole branch of the political noise you can cut away and not have to bother with. Those words are exchangeable and don't mean any more than they have been defined to mean. When discussing things, there is no reason to argue about definitions. It's a dead end, discussion wise, because the definitions never prove a point themselves, regardless of what some people think. What I noticed works really well is to discuss a topic using whatever definitions other people make. Use those to make your argument. I've had lots of good experiences with that.
