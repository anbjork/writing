Surely, a benevolent elite would rule more optimally? Perhaps, but the track record seems to show that whenever elites take power, they sooner or later seem to forget about the people, and start pursuing other goals that they feel more strongly for. And so, it stops being government for the common good, and only for the elite itself. There are also numerous cases where the elite becomes so fixated on hoarding resources for themselves or their passion projects that they end up bankrupting the nation.

Perhaps democracy is not an optimal way to run things. Perhaps that's not the point. Perhaps democracy should be seen as a very defensive choice, to apply to systems that we really don't want to fail, like nations. For such, it could be worth sacrificing some efficiency for increased stability or robustness.

In addition, I don't have another good option to suggest for avoiding a ruling elite that becomes self obsessed. I don't see any examples put into practice in the world around us.

Note that not all organisations are run democratically. Companies for example, are top down hierarchies starting from the people that own them. I imagine this system is sometimes faster, more nimble and efficient than a slow grinding democratic process. But also, it's okay when companies fail (except some banks and similar, who are too big to fail, which is bull shit. Dangerous bull shit), so a more aggressive type of organisation may be a more optimal one for them.

Swedish political parties, in their eager for democracy is themselves democratic organisations, so creates a bit of a russian doll situation. They have yearly congresses where party members vote on policy to push, and veto other policy. I'm not sure that's a good idea at all. I imagine they could get a lot more done if they were run by a party elite. Like a company, if a certain political party fails, not too big of a problem. So maybe a more optimal governance by an elite, a more aggressive organisation, would be worth the potential sacrifice in stability?

Ugh, the general idea is there but the writing is crap. Better go to bed.
