Math is unique. It is self sufficient. It does not rely on any external source of information. And it's about the only thing that doesn't. Math works the same in different languages. On different planets. It would work the same in any conceivable universe. Even if the very core changes completely, like the laws of physics. I don't know anything else that would work the same in any conceivable universe. Do you? It's a fascinating quality

You might define different terms. So you might think you have changed things by changing definitions. But you haven't. Math doesn't care. It does its thing regardless. If you stop twisting definitions, you'll come back to the same fundamental truths. And so you realise that the definitions are not the starting point, even if those tend to be presented before theorems and proofs in textbooks. The definitions are simply attempts to describe concepts in ways that allows us to uncover the underlying fundamental truths the easiest and cleanest. Simply an attempt to find the most productive tools for the job.
