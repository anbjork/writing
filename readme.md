Some things I think about.

Because there is so much bouncing around my head, and I want to do something with it all, but I don't know what. Maybe I am hoping it will allow me to scrutinise my thoughts better, and so kind of discuss with myself, to proceed.

Probably trying to keep them short and sweet, because I don't want to pad with fluff unecessarily. Enough of the world is already geared towards wasting peoples time, and luckily these texts are unaffected by many of the incentives most notorious for such waste.

I will probably not back things up with a lot of references, at least not initially. I feel more excited to just get thoughts on print. Might come back around later and add as necessary.
